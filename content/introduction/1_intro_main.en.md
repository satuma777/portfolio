I’m Shota Saito and a master’s course student at [Yokohama National University](http://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/index.html) in Japan. I’m interested in the **Machine Learning** and **Evolutionary Computation**. I have been focused on **Hyper-parameter Optimization and Structure Optimization for Neural Network**. In general, exploring the best hyper-parameter and architecture need huge computational costs, respectively. My research aims to develop **efficient hyper-parameter (or architecture of neural network) optimization method**.
