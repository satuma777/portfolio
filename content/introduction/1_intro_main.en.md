I'm Shota Saito and a master's course student at [Yokohama National University](http://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/index.html) in Japan. I'm interested in **Machine Learning (especially Deep Neural Network)** and **Evolutionary Computation**, and have been focused on **Hyper-paramater Optimization** and **Neural Architecture Search**. In general, exploring the best hyper-paramater and architecture need huge computational costs, respectively. My research aim to develop **efficient hyper-paramter (or architecture of neural network) optimization method**.
