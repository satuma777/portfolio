I am working a machine learning engineer and lecture on machine learning at [SkillUp AI Co., Ltd.](https://www.skillupai.com) in Tokyo, Japan.

Moreover, I am enrolled in a doctoral course at [Yokohama National University](http://www.ynu.ac.jp/english/index.html) in Kanagawa, Japan.  My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, and evolutionary computation. I'm particularly interested in hyperparameter optimization and structure optimization of neural networks. In general, searching for hyperparameters and structures is expensive. Therefore, we are conducting research with the goal of developing an efficient hyperparameter (or structure) optimization algorithm based on the stochastic model-based evolutionary algorithm.
